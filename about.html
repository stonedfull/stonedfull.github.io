                    Producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that
                    users interacts with. A website must both please the eye and feel great to use to achieve the most
                    for your business. That's why I believe the best user experiences are created by those that are
                    experienced in these multiple fields. The added benefit of a hybrid designer/developer is that they
                    can work with the full scope of a project in mind; simplifying the process of working amongst a team
                    and producing a more cohesive experience for your users.

                    Creating a future-oriented and easy-to-maintain website is achieved by breaking the web page into
                    the smallest parts, often called components, and building them in such a way that they exist outside
                    the context of the design in which they first appear. This allows for components that can be reused.
                    used in other areas of the website as it grows and makes it easier for other developers to
                    understand and test. Wherever possible, I find it valuable to create a style guide that acts as a
                    document for a reusable and maintained code base. All project participants can rely on a style guide
                    to understand the project language and create a more consistent user interface. Reusable components
                    allow your website to grow rapidly, just like your business.

                    I have a particular interest in using animation on the net. I especially enjoy working on websites
                    that have smooth transitions and require high performance to maintain a smooth and attractive
                    website.

                <h2 class="wow fadeInLeft">Design & Prototyping</h2>
                <p class="wow fadeInLeft">
                    I believe it is important to understand both design and development to achieve a successful
                    user-facing product. Traditionally, a design is created and then a front-end developer is expected
                    to code it. My preferred method of producing a website is to design but keep technical challenges in
                    mind so they can be solved during the design phase. By working in this way, the best design and
                    technical decisions can be made in tandem and the website remains beautiful, fast, and easy to use.
                    There's no need to go back to change the designs once coding is under way. It's a more efficient way
                    of working that gets the right result the first time around.

                    Typically my design process consists of researching your requirements, analysing competitors in your
                    field, and holding a design meeting to get your initial ideas. Where required, I can produce a mood
                    board to give a "feel" for the website that influences the designs. I will then take these learnings
                    and produce a first round of designs. With your feedback, I will then iterate on the designs to meet
                    your expectations.

                <p class="wow fadeInLeft">
                    I am also a keen advocate of producing prototypes before fully coding. These prototypes are a hybrid
                    of design and interaction that enable a team to experience how a user interface will feel before it
                    is coded. This gives an opportunity for all involved to provide feedback at an early stage and be a
                    part of the iteration process.
